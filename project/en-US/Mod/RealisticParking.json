This system counts every time a car pathfinds to a parking lane, and once enough cars have routed to it, it will disable that spot for future pathfinding. The system resets once the spot is full or enough time passes.",

  "Options.OPTION_DESCRIPTION[RealisticParking.RealisticParking.Mod.Setting.InducedDemandInitialTolerance]": "The number of cars for parking lanes to initially let pathfind in without considering the queue size per spot. For example, if there are 2 spots open and this is set to 5 and the queue size per spot to 1, the parking spot will be disabled after 7 cars have pathfinded to that spot. If this setting is set to a low number with limited parking spots in the city, it may result in a low number of cars driving around.",

In the vanilla system, a car can sense that the parking spot they are navigating to is full up to 4000 nodes away. This causes random u-turns on main roads, as they will suddenly change parking destinations while driving. This system aims to get rid of that by only letting the car sense that the parking is unavailable from a closer distance.",
